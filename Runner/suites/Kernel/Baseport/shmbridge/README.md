# shmbridge Validation test

## Overview

This test case validates the presence and initialization of the Qualcomm Secure Channel Manager (QCOM_SCM) interface on the device. It ensures that:

- The kernel is configured with QCOM_SCM support
- The dmesg logs contain expected `qcom_scm` entries
- There are no "probe failure" messages in the logs

## Usage

Instructions:

1. **Copy repo to Target Device**: Use `scp` to transfer the scripts from the host to the target device. The scripts should be copied to any directory on the target device.
2. **Verify Transfer**: Ensure that the repo has been successfully copied to the target device.
3. **Run Scripts**: Navigate to the directory where these files are copied on the target device and execute the scripts as needed.

Run the SHM Bridge test using:
---
#### Quick Example
```sh
git clone <this-repo>
cd <this-repo>
scp -r common Runner user@target_device_ip:<Path in device>
ssh user@target_device_ip
cd <Path in device>/Runner && ./run-test.sh shmbridge
```
---
## Prerequisites
1. zcat, grep, and dmesg must be available.
2. Root access may be required to write to read kernel logs.

 ## Result Format
Test result will be saved in `shmbridge.res` as:  
## Output
A .res file is generated in the same directory:

`shmbridge PASS`  OR   `shmbridge FAIL`
