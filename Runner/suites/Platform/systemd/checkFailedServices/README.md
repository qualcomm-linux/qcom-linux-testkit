# checkFailedServices Validation Test

## Overview

This test script checks for any failed systemd services on the device. It is intended for use on platforms running systemd and is part of the Qualcomm Linux Testkit.

## Usage

1. Ensure the testkit environment is set up and the board has systemd as init manager.
2. Make the script executable if not already so:
   ```sh
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```
3. Run the test:
   ```sh
   ./run.sh
   ```
4. Check the result:
   - If the test passes, `checkFailedServices.res` will contain `checkFailedServices PASS`.
   - If the test fails, `checkFailedServices.res` will contain `checkFailedServices FAIL` and the failed services will be logged.

## Integration

This test can be invoked by the top-level runner as:
```sh
cd Runner
./run-test.sh checkFailedServices
```
The `.res` file can be parsed by CI/LAVA to determine the overall test status.

## Result Format

- **PASS**: No failed services detected.
- **FAIL**: One or more services are in a failed state.

The result is written to `checkFailedServices.res` in the same directory.

## Dependencies

- **systemctl**: Must be available and functional (systemd-based system).
- **POSIX shell**: Script is written for `/bin/sh`.

## Logging

- Uses `log_info`, `log_pass`, and `log_fail` from `functestlib.sh` for standardized output.
